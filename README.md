- 👋 Hi, I’m @julia-rodrigo
     I have been studying computer science for almost 4 years now.
     I am going to graduate soon and I am looking for a job opportunity
     near Cork, Dublin or remotely.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... 
     Computer programming experience in any of field besides unit/API testing and uses of test frameworks.
     I want to improve my coding skills around people.
     I am trying to learn database such as MongoDB since databases was my weakpoint in assignments
     I am more confident in React development with javascript and typescript.
     I also would like to improve on game development too.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... 
     TypeScript and tailwindCSS in next-react-app framework and features such as nextauth and MongoDb
  
     I have made a short monster-catching rpg game in Godot for my university Project. I made some small sprites and spritesheets using Piskel software. I love bringing my sprites to life and add some system rules to interact with them.
  
     I like using TypeScript as I learnt it from my Internship and have recently built my
     resume from TypeScript. I like the use of tailwindcss to make the app easily responsive on all devices
     Deploying the app on Vercel is a huge advantage in Next.js.
     Each time I make new changes, the app is automatically updated!
     This way, I can check my phone to see if my outcome is as desired.
     
     Back in my internship from last year (2022), I was focusing on:
     How website apps work and how to make connections with the databases. 
     I still find this interesting and I would love try another year in this area.
     

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... 
     Making a pokemon-like game with other fans of the franchaise. Or any pixel rpg format.
     I would also like to make a new reponsive app.
     In the future, I am planning to learn Unreal Engine to increase my chance of being recuited into gaming development and because the game UI that inspired me "octopath traveller" was made in this engine.
