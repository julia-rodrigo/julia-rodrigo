- 👋 Hi, I’m @julia-rodrigo
     I have been studying computer science for almost 4 years now.
     I am going to graduate soon and I am looking for a graduate program
     perhaps near or in Dublin, or in Cork
     or remotely

- 👀 I’m interested in ... 
     Computer programming experience in any of the industry.
     I want to improve my coding skills around people. 
     I would like anything in React development as I learnt this in my internship.
     I am not too interested in API testing or testing in general.
     I am most interested in gaming, 
     
     but almost anything will do 
     as I am still exploring where I wish to stand.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... 
     Game development. I have made a short battle system in Godot for my university Project.
     I made some small sprites using Piscels software. I know how to make spritesheets.
     But I am more interested in how to use the gaming engine to bring my sprites to life 
     and add some system rules to the game.
     There are so many cool interesting secrets I have yet to discover from Godot. 
     But I am open to learning other engines, especially Unreal Engine.
     
     Back in my internship from last year (2022), I was focusing on:
     How website apps work and how to make connections with the databases. 
     I still find this interesting and I would love try another year in this area.
     

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... 
     Making a pokemon-like game with other fans of the franchaise. Or any pixel rpg format. 
     But to be honest, just about anything to do with coding 
     in a gaming engine is a huge benefit for me already.
     
     I will be happy with anything to do with experience in a computer science driven company.
