- 👋 Hi, I’m @julia-rodrigo
     I have been studying computer science for almost 4 years now.
     I am going to graduate soon and I am looking for a job opportunity
     near Cork, Dublin or remotely.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... 
     Computer programming experience in any of the industry.
     I want to improve my coding skills around people. 
     I would like anything in React development as I learnt this in my internship.
     I am not too interested in API testing or testing in general.
     I also would like to improve on game developement too.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... 
     Game development in Godot and TypeScript in Next.js React framework.
  
     I have made a short monster-catching rpg game in Godot for my university Project.
     I made some small sprites and spritesheets using Piscels software.
     I am more interested in how to use the gaming engine to bring my sprites to life 
     and add some system rules to the game.
     There are so many cool interesting secrets I have yet to discover from Godot. 
     But I am open to learning other engines, especially Unreal Engine.

     I like using TypeScript as I learnt it from my Internship and have recently built my
     resume from TypeScript. I like the use of tailwindcss to make the app easily responsive on all devices
     Deploying the app on Vercel is a huge advantage in Next.js.
     Each time I make new changes, the app is automatically updated!
     This way, I can check my phone to see if my outcome is as desired.
     It would be fantastic if gaming engines had this feature.
     
     Back in my internship from last year (2022), I was focusing on:
     How website apps work and how to make connections with the databases. 
     I still find this interesting and I would love try another year in this area.
     

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... 
     Making a pokemon-like game with other fans of the franchaise. Or any pixel rpg format.
     I would also like to make a new reponsive app.
  In the future, I am planning to learn either Figma for improving UI web design, or Unreal Engine to increase my chance of being recuited into gaming development.
     
     I will be happy with anything to do with experience in a computer science driven company.
